                    <p>Hello, Camilla here! I have a background in Communication Science (a very research based field) but always had a passion for visuals, art and design, and that is why I enrolled in Polimi. I have experience in digital marketing where I developed my skills in content creation and especially storytelling. In my freetime I love hiking and being in nature, running, baking and dancing.  </p>

                    <p>Hello, I am Sara, an artistic soul who studied at the Faculty of Arts, learned graphic design, and I am here to enhance my design skills. Even though I love manual work, printmaking and painting, I am proficient with Adobe's creative programs and would love to know more about 3Ds. If I'm not doing something creative, you can find me hiking, anywhere in nature, in a yoga studio, and I enjoy sunsets, old towns, and skiing.</p>
